package host_test

// TODO(#2755): Add integration tests for the host instrumentation. These tests
// depend on https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go/issues/3031
// being resolved.
//
// The added tests will depend on the metric SDK. Therefore, they should be
// added to a sub-directory called "test" instead of this file.
