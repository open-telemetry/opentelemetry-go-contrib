# go-chi chi instrumentation example

An HTTP server using go-chi chi and instrumentation. The server has a
`/users/:id` endpoint. The server generates span information to
`stdout`.

These instructions expect you have
[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed.

Bring up the `chi-server` and `chi-client` services to run the
example:

```sh
docker-compose up --detach chi-server chi-client
```

The `chi-client` service sends just one HTTP request to `chi-server`
and then exits. View the span generated by `chi-server` in the logs:

```sh
docker-compose logs chi-server
```

Shut down the services when you are finished with the example:

```sh
docker-compose down
```
