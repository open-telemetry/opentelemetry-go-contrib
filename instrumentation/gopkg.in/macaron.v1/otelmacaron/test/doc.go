Package test validates the otelmacaron instrumentation with the default SDK.

This package is in a separate module from the instrumentation it tests to
isolate the dependency of the default SDK and not impose this as a transitive
dependency for users.

Deprecated: otelmacaron has no Code Owner.
After August 21, 2024, it may no longer be supported and may stop
receiving new releases unless a new Code Owner is found. See
[this issue] if you would like to become the Code Owner of this module.
