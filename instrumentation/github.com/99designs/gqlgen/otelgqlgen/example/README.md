# gqlgen Instrumentation Example

Create an example span from gqlgen.
These instructions expect you have [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed.

Bring up the `gqlgen-server` service and example `gqlgen-client` service to send an example request:

```sh
docker-compose up --detach gqlgen-server gqlgen-client
```

The `gqlgen-client` service sends just one request and exit. Retrieve the response generated by the `gqlgen-server` service; should be the last line in the logs:

```sh
docker-compose logs --tail=1 gqlgen-client
```

The `gqlgen-server` using stdout exporter for opentelemetry, so we can see TraceID in logs:
```sh
docker-compose logs gqlgen-server | grep 'TraceID' | head -1
```

Shut down the services when you are finished with the example:

```sh
docker-compose down
```
